# Tell me how many people U live with and I'll tell you how rich U are: a study of household size and income in the city of Barcelona

How is wealth related to the number of people living in a household? On one hand, we could expect such relationship to be positive. After all, richer people can afford having more children. But we also have reasons to expect the opposite trend. Indeed, in developed countries people with less resources have more children, leave the paternal household later in life, and often live with extended family. By exploring data from the city of Barcelona, I proved that both former intuitions are true, and found a non-monotonic, U-shaped relationship between income and household size. Those with lower and higher income tend to live with more people, whereas middle-income people inhabit less populated households. 

The datasets I worked with can be found on the city's [Open Data Portal](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en). In particular, I used a dataset including the [average tax revenue per person](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/renda-tributaria-per-persona-atlas-distribucio/resource/7e2ab9ed-68ea-43ea-abb0-afbb620ee09e), and another containing the [Number of households in Barcelona aggregated by the number of people in the household](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/pad_dom_mdbas_n-persones/resource/66985e32-b3c1-4f3e-a987-f880a4c509d3). In both cases I used the yearly data for 2021, as it was most recent update both datasets shared.
